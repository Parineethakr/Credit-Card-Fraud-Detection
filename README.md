# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

This project implements a complete **Machine Learning pipeline** for high-performance credit card fraud detection.  
The focus is on **robust handling of class imbalance** and **optimization for the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC)**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

To train, optimize, and evaluate classification models capable of identifying rare fraudulent transactions with **high sensitivity (recall)** while maintaining acceptable **precision**.

---

## ðŸ§© Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run the `fraud_detection.py` script:

- `numpy`  
- `pandas`  
- `scikit-learn`  
- `imbalanced-learn`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `seaborn`

### Installation

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn imbalanced-learn matplotlib seaborn
